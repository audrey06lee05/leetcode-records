# ‚úèÔ∏è Leetcode Records
‚ú® This is a repository that stores the LeetCode questions I did in preparing for my graduate applications. <br/>
‚ú® I find this extremely useful as it makes GitHub record my code activity even though I am not working on projects. 

## üîß Set Up 
1. Download LeetHub on Chrome Extensions Store
2. Create a repository on your github account
3. Press the LeetHub extension and fill in the repository name
4. Do LeetCode questions and it will **automatically** add files into the repository

##### I hope you find this useful!
